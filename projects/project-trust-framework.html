      Developed a mathematical model to quantify the trustworthiness of each robot in a Multi-Robot System (MRS) based on its inherent features, such as capabilities.<br>
      Designed and developed a trust model that updates the robotâ€™s capabilities based on the outcomes of allocated tasks to the robots and evaluated the proposed novel trust framework against metrics such as trust convergence.<br>
      The proposed trust framework was evaluated against the existing trust frameworks in the literature and achieved 100% task allocation using the trust framework in a Python (using numpy, libraries) based simulation for a given mathematical distribution of incoming tasks to the MRS.<br>
      Awarded Best Thesis with the highest possible grade of 1.0 (German grading system).
